    <h1>Welcome! This is the first update!</h1> 
    <h2>2021-04-11</h2>
    <p>I wanted to put together a website from scratch to really gather an understanding of how to completely personalize my own site, and maybe save myself a few bucks too.</p> 
    <p>I am hosting this page 100% free via GitHub and Netlify, manually coded through VS Code.</p>
    <p>As a test, I would like to use this site to practice the things that I learn and post them on the web. They will be linked in special ways throughout this page when I grow my experience.</p>
    <p>As an axample, this is all written directly without any document builders, manually typing each tag to make it a paragraph, and starting each paragraph on a new line.</p>
    <p>I hope to link each project as a new page like <a href="https://github.com/RubeHicksCube" target="_blank">Here</a> and open to all to see exactly how I make a site like this.</p>
    <p>Right now all that has been put together on the site is a Home page and some links to colterhicks.com. Come back later for more updates to this page!</p>
