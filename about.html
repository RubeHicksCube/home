    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Colter Hicks.</p>
    <p>I have always wanted my own little spot on the internet that could be accessed from anywhere, and recently found out that is much harder and more expensive than I originally thought.</p>
    <p>So I made this site 100% myself! I wanted a space to share some tips and tricks that I've learned in life and generally have some fun making something most people don't know how to.</p>
    <p>But my goal is to share the info to make it so eventually everyone can!</p>
    <p>I love to share what I learn, and make it as simple as possible because it's probably the same thing I did!</p>
    <p>If you learn something here, then my goal has been reached!</p>
