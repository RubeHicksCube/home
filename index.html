			<h1>First Post!</h1> 
			<p>2021-04-11</p>
            <p>Welcome, I wanted to put together a website from scratch to really gather an understanding of how to completely personalize my own site, and maybe save myself a few bucks too.</p> 
			<p>I am hosting this page 100% free via GitHub and Netlify, manually coded through VS Code.</p>
            <p>As a test, I would like to use this site to practice the things that I learn and post them on the web. They will be linked in special ways throughout this page when I grow my experience.</p>
            <p>As an axample, this is all written directly in the code without any document builders, manually typing each tag to make it a paragraph, and starting each paragraph on a new line.</p>
            <p>I hope to link each project as a new page like <a href="https://github.com/RubeHicksCube" target="_blank">Here</a> and open to all to see exactly how I make a site like this.</p>

            <p>This is my main website. It is hosted on Wordpress for now and using SiteGround as a host. The reason I wanted to try to learn how to code is because this method costs me in excess of $100 per year, which is way too much to simply have a static page website with a few blog pages.</p>
            <p>This is what inspired me to find the cheapest way to host a website publicly, without taking up any pocket change.</p>
            <p>When this site changes location, I will update this information to match.</p>
