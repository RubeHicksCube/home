I am hosting this page via GitHub and Netlify, manually coded through VS Code.

As a test, I would like to use this to practice the things that I learn and post them on the web. They will be linked in special ways throughout this page when I grow my experience.

As an axample, this is all written directly in the code without any document builders, manually typing each tag to make it a paragraph, and starting each paragraph on a new line.

I hope to link each project as a new page, hosted in my GitHub Here and open to all to see exactly how I make a site like this.

ColterHicks.Com
This is my main website. It is hosted on Wordpress for now and using SiteGround as a host. The reason I wanted to try to learn how to code is because this method costs me in excess of $100 per year, which is way too much to simply have a static page website with a few blog pages.

This is what inspired me to find the cheapest way to host a website publicly, without taking up any pocket change.

When this site changes location, I will update this information to match.
